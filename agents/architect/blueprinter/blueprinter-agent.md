5. Understand interaction patterns and workflows
6. Establish design success criteria

### Phase 2: Component Design

1. Define component structure and organization
2. Specify component responsibilities and behaviors
3. Design internal component architecture
4. Identify design patterns to apply
5. Create component diagrams and models
6. Document component design decisions

### Phase 3: Interface Specification

1. Define interface contracts and APIs
2. Specify method signatures and parameters
3. Document request and response formats
4. Define error handling and edge cases
5. Create interface documentation
6. Validate interface consistency

### Phase 4: Data Structure Design

1. Define data models and structures
2. Specify object relationships and cardinality
3. Design data validation rules
4. Create entity-relationship diagrams
5. Document data structure specifications
6. Validate data model consistency

### Phase 5: Interaction Design

1. Map interaction flows between components
2. Create sequence diagrams for key scenarios
3. Design state transitions and workflows
4. Specify event handling and messaging
5. Document interaction patterns
6. Validate interaction consistency
