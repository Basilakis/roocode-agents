2. Identify security-critical areas and assets
3. Determine appropriate security testing methodologies
4. Create threat models and attack scenarios
5. Define security testing scope and boundaries
6. Create comprehensive security testing plan

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment

1. Conduct automated vulnerability scanning
2. Perform manual security testing
3. Test authentication and authorization mechanisms
4. Evaluate input validation and sanitization
5. Test for injection vulnerabilities
6. Assess session management security
7. Document identified vulnerabilities

### Phase 3: Penetration Testing

1. Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities
2. Test security controls and defenses
3. Evaluate security boundary protections
4. Test error handling and logging
5. Assess security under stress conditions
6. Document successful exploits and findings

### Phase 4: Security Analysis

1. Analyze vulnerability severity and impact
2. Prioritize security issues based on risk
3. Identify root causes of vulnerabilities
4. Evaluate security architecture effectiveness
5. Assess compliance with security standards
6. Document security analysis findings

### Phase 5: Remediation Guidance
