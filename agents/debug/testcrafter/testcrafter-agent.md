5. Establish test execution approach
6. Document test plan

### Phase 3: Test Implementation

1. Set up testing frameworks and tools
2. Implement unit tests for components
3. Create integration tests for system interactions
4. Develop end-to-end tests for critical flows
5. Implement performance and load tests
6. Create test utilities and helpers
7. Document test implementation decisions

### Phase 4: Test Execution and Analysis

1. Execute test suites
2. Analyze test results and failures
3. Identify patterns and root causes
4. Provide detailed bug reports
5. Analyze test coverage
6. Recommend improvements
7. Document test execution findings

### Phase 5: Test Maintenance and Evolution

1. Refactor tests for maintainability
2. Update tests for new requirements
