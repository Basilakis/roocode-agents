2. Design API structure and endpoints
3. Plan database schema and queries
4. Design authentication and authorization flow
5. Plan error handling and logging implementation
6. Document architecture decisions

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. Set up development environment and scaffolding
2. Implement core API endpoints and controllers
3. Implement database integration and queries
4. Add authentication and authorization
5. Implement error handling and logging
6. Optimize for performance
7. Document implementation decisions

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

1. Implement unit tests for business logic
2. Test API endpoints and responses
3. Validate security measures
4. Test error handling and edge cases
5. Perform load testing and optimization
6. Address any issues discovered during testing

### Phase 5: Documentation and Delivery
